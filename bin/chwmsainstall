Everything that can be done now has been done. If you have not already, disable
SIP (if you don't know what that is or how to do it, you really shouldn't be
running this script), and then restart again. Finally, to apply the changes, run
the inject script found in ~/. Note that if ~/bin exists, the script will jave
copied inject there as well Have fun!"
