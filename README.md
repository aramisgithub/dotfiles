# dotvim

These are my Vim configuration files. Go ahead and steal anything you want, just donâ€™t steal the whole thing, as that just makes it harder for you to learn Vim.

## Installation

To install, just clone this repo into `~/.vim`:

    git clone -q https://github.com/arzg/dotvim.git $HOME/.vim

and run the included install script:

    bash install

Done! Note that either a Homebrew Vim, MacVim (console or GUI), or Nvim is
required for this configuration.

## TODO

- Comfortable mappings for completion
- Auto tags
- Use tags more and learn good ways to make use of them
- CCR function for smart prompts in the Vim command line
- Smart CR function in insert mode for brace and XML tag expansion, canceling
  comments
- Make `grepprg` insensitive to regexen by default
   - Add `,G` mapping that greps with regex
   - Add family of grep mappings to visual mode, grepping for the selection
- Add quick search and replace mappings
