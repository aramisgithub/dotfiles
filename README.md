# dotvim

These are my Vim configuration files. Go ahead and steal anything you want, just donâ€™t steal the whole thing, as that just makes it harder for you to learn Vim.

## Installation

To install, just clone this repo into `~/.vim`:

    git clone -q https://github.com/arzg/dotvim.git $HOME/.vim

and run the included install script:

    bash install

Done! Note that either a Homebrew Vim, MacVim (console or GUI), or Nvim is
required for this configuration.

## Todo

- Auto tags
- Use tags more and learn good ways to make use of them
- Add quick search and replace mappings
- Highlight current search with IncSearch (with
  [loupe](https://github.com/wincent/loupe)?)
- Xcode-style search and pair highlighting
   - Use [matchup](https://github.com/andymass/vim-matchup) to achieve this
