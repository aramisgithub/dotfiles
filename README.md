# dotvim

These are my Vim configuration files. Go ahead and steal anything you want, just don’t steal the whole thing, as that just makes it harder for you to learn Vim.

## Installation

To install, just clone this repo into `~/.vim`:

    git clone -q https://github.com/arzg/dotvim.git $HOME/.vim

and make sure Vim is sourcing this repo’s `vimrc`:

    echo "runtime vimrc" > $HOME/.vimrc

Done!
